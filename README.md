# Counting Rows
*Like Counting **C**rows. Ha, get it?*

Deployed on Netlify: https://countingrows.netlify.app/

A web-based tool to help me keep track of the rows I've knitted of various charts and/or patterns. 

- No ads, no bloat from unnecessary features.
- Counters are saved to and loaded from localStorage for simplicity.
- Made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for funsies.
